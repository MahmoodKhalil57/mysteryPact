each turn someone can be secretLeader, there will be a random maximum amount of times someone can be secretLeader so the more they get secretLeader the less likely they get secretLeader again, secretLeader knows they are a secretLeader 
each turn someone else will be "secretCorrespondent", there will be a random maximum amount of times someone can be "secretCorrespondent" so the more they get secretLeader the less likely they get secretLeader again, "secretCorrespondent" doesnt know they are a "secretCorrespondent" 
there will be a message board where everyone is anonymous, secretLeader can be shiny so others know the hints provided
after some time, everyone will get a chance to vote who is secretLeader, including secretLeader
each time "secretCorrespondent "votes for secretLeader, both get a point
each time non-"correspondents" votes for secretLeader, secretLeader loses a point and non-"correspondents" gets a point, if not secretLeader gains and non-"correspondents" lose points

settings:
number of turns can be variable
number of point rewards and punishment can be variable
votes can be visible or not
hardmode: in the message board, secretLeader could be non-distiquishable from other players so no one knows if the hints are real

first second and third winners are decided based on points after the turns

Alright, gather 'round, ye olde internet pals! Welcome to the wild, wacky, and ever-mystifying world of "Whodunnit Whisperers!" üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí¨

Here's the lowdown:

    To dive into this cauldron of chaos, you'll need to rally at least two other thrill-seekers. Why? Because trios are terrific, and solitaire is so yesterday.
    Each spine-tingling turn, one of you becomes the "Sneaky Chief" (formerly known as the oh-so-dull "secretLeader"). This sly fox knows they're in charge, but here's the twist: their reign has an expiry date that's as unpredictable as a cat on a skateboard!
    Hold onto your hats because someone else morphs into the "Incognito Messenger" (goodbye, "secretCorrespondent"!). But shhh...they won't know it's them. It's like being elected the mayor of a town you've never visited.
    Then there's the "Chattering Crew," the folks who aren't "it" but are integral to this merry mess. They're just...well, everyone else.

Here's where it gets juicier than a gossip magazine:

    There's a message board! An anonymous one! The Sneaky Chief can sparkle like a disco ball in a sea of grey if they wish, dropping hints with the subtlety of a marching band.
    After an eternity (or what feels like it), everyone votes on who they think the Sneaky Chief is. It's like a high school popularity contest but with more secrecy and fewer prom outfits.
    If the Incognito Messenger, in a stroke of uninformed genius, votes for the Sneaky Chief, they both get a point! It's like pinning the tail on the donkey blindfolded and nailing it!
    But wait, there's more! If the Chattering Crew casts a successful vote against the Sneaky Chief, the Chief loses a point, and the Crew member scores! Miss, and it's a boomerang of doom (points-wise).

Settings, you ask? We've got 'em!

    Turns: Long or short, like choosing between binge-watching a series or savoring an episode per week.
    Points: Because who doesn't like to tweak the value of victory and the sting of defeat?
    Votes: Show 'em, hide 'em‚Äîlike choosing between a magician revealing their secrets or keeping you guessing.
    Hardmode: The Sneaky Chief blends in. Good luck sorting through THAT carnival of confusion!

Winners? We rank 'em first, second, and third‚Äîbecause everyone loves a podium finish.

So, what are you waiting for? Dive into "Whodunnit Whisperers" and let the clandestine chaos commence! üéâüîç‚ú®
